## 💥 First Steps: Starting the Game Right

If you're reading this Uma Musume beginner guide, congrats—you're officially in too deep. First things first:

### 🎰 Reroll Like You Mean It

Yes, rerolling is annoying. But if you found this guide on Reddit or Steam, chances are someone already told you: **rerolling the support card gacha is 100% worth it.**

There are two gacha types:
- **Pretty Derby Gacha** → Get new characters to train
- **Support Card Gacha** → Power up your training with bonus stats, events, and skills

**Pro tip:** Reroll support cards. Period. Strong cards make your training sessions way better, especially for newbies looking to get ahead.

#### Why Support > Characters (Early On)
Characters are cool, but support cards literally carry your whole run. If you're a beginner, or following a Uma Musume beginner guide Reddit thread, every top comment will scream: **support cards first.**

You'll be low on jewels—don’t waste them pulling waifus yet.

## 🌟 Best First Pick for Starters

Got that free ⭐️3 character ticket? Open the **Shop → Ticket Exchange** and pick smart. Here's our top pick:

### 💪 Go With **Oguri Cap**

She’s cracked for beginners:
- Super flexible across distances (except short)
- Has an OP unique skill
- +20% Speed growth → makes training a breeze
- Works well on dirt tracks early-game (trust me, that matters)

If you’re coming from a Uma Musume starter guide Reddit search, Oguri is always near the top.

#### Or Pick Your Best Girl

Meta is great. Vibes are better. If you love Special Week, Rice Shower, or Twin Turbo, go for them. You’ll unlock:
- Their storylines
- Home screen convos
- Live Theater content (the music slaps)

Play who you like. Period. This is a newbie guide, not a competitive spreadsheet. 🚀

## 🏋️ Training 101: Getting Strong Fast

### 💡 Match Support Cards to Your Girl

Every Uma Musume has strengths. Match cards to boost what she’s already good at:

- Training Speed? Use Speed-type cards (top-right icon)
- Going for long-distance races? Stack stamina + relevant skills

If you’re checking a Uma Musume beginner guide Steam post and don’t know what any of this means yet, don’t worry. You’ll get it fast.

### 🐎 Training Loop Basics

Once your team is ready:
1. Train your girl
2. Win races
3. Get stronger
4. Unlock story content

Some stories are adorable. Some are bananas. All worth it.

### 👑 Post-Training = Hall of Fame Time

When you finish training, your Uma goes into the Hall of Fame. From there:
- She can be inherited by future girls (stats + skills)
- She joins your Team Race lineup

Think of this as breeding idols with better stats. Wild but cool.
