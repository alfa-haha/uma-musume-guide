# 🎯 Daily Must-Do Guide for New Uma Musume Trainers

## 👯‍♀️ Step 1: Add Friends with Maxed-Out SSRs and OP Inherited Horses

First rule of Uma Club? **Surround yourself with overpowered friends**.

* Fill your entire friend list with trainers who have:

  * **Max Limit-Break SSR support cards**
  * **Top-tier inherited horses (★9 total blue stars is ideal!)**

    * Stamina★9, Power★9, or a mix = super useful
    * Extra bonus if they’ve got URA or Aoharu scenario traits!

📚 **Need help finding them?**
Head over to the Uma Musume DB:

**Must-follow SSR cards include:**

* SSR Kitasan Black (god-tier)
* SSR Fine Motion
* SSR Tazuna
* SSR Rice Shower (Power)
* SSR Riko Kashimoto
* SSR Nice Nature (Intelligence)
  ...and the list goes on.

🎯 **Goal:** Raise your friend cap to 55 ASAP by spending Friend Points. More friends = more power.

## ⭐️ Pick Oguri Cap with Your Free ★3 Ticket — Seriously!

Got a ★3 Exchange Ticket at the start?
Unless you're obsessed with a specific waifu, **always pick Oguri Cap**.

Why?

* **Dirt-track compatible** (huge for Team Races)
* **Runs everything except short distance** like a boss
* **Signature skill** “Victory Beat” is top-tier (rated “Sugoku”) and easy to trigger
* Few others have that level of flexibility — you're gonna *regret it hard* if you skip her. I’ve seen it happen. A lot.

📛 Trust me: this is a no-do-over kind of choice.

## 📖 Clear Main Story for Free SSR Support Cards

Yes, the story is wholesome and all, but more importantly —
**Every cleared chapter = free SSR support**. 💎

They’re not as cracked as gacha ones, but they’re totally clutch for F2P (free-to-play) or low-spenders.

💡 You’ll need those for Circle Point trades later too, so don’t slack!

---

## 👟 Join a “Shoe-Sharing” Circle and Collect Circle Points

You can earn **up to 200 Circle Points a day**:

* 100 from being rented out by friends
* 100 from donating **shoes** in your Circle

That’s why tons of Circles do this “Shoe Donation” thing. It’s real. It works. It’s wholesome.

Search Twitter for:
`#UmaMusumeCircleRecruitment`

Pick one that’s active and generous. Your points = future SSRs.
Use 'em to **limit break story SSRs** like:

* 🔥 Narita Brian
* 💎 Mejiro McQueen
* 🎫 Winning Ticket
* 🌧 Rice Shower

(In that priority order.)

---

## 💸 Do Your Daily Races (Pick Maaaaaney 💰)

You can run 3 races a day and choose between:

* **Money (Manny)**
* **Support Pt**

At first, Support Pt is fine.
But trust me, long-term? **Money is the real bottleneck.**

You’ll need it for:

* Leveling Support Cards
* Buying “Pieces” in Sales
* Raising Awakening Lv

So yeah, farm cash like a broke college kid.

## 💰 Spend Money Smart: Support Cards First, Then Star Up Pieces

Early game money = tight.
Here’s where it should go:

1. **Level up your support cards**
2. **Buy ★1–2 Pieces in the Limited Sale** to star them up to ★3

Why bother?
Once a girl hits ★3:

* Her unique skill gets stronger
* She unlocks her victory outfit + extra story scenes

Bonus buys (when needed):

* Motivation Up Sweets
* Alarm Clocks (undo training fails — lifesavers!)

---

## 💎 Save Free Jewels for *The* Banner

Don’t blow your gems on every banner that drops.
Instead:

* **Stockpile like a dragon**
* Wait for **super-meta banners** (like SSR Kitasan Black or SSR Yukino Bijin)

Pulling hard at the right time > random rolls with regrets.

---

## 🔧 Exchange Unused Support Cards for Medals Monthly

Got junk SRs or way too many R cards?
Trade 'em in the Support Card Room for **horseshoes **.

Then every month:

* **Use SR-tier horseshoes** to grab an SR guaranteed gacha ticket
* **Exchange regular tickets too**, but DON’T USE THEM YET — save for banner sniping

---

## 🔄 Build at Least One Maxed-Out Gacha SSR for Friend Points

Eventually, aim to **fully limit break** a strong gacha SSR.
Why?

* People will rent it
* You’ll get **tons of Friend Points**
* You can then:

  * Max your friend cap
  * Trade for more Support Points every month
  * Be everyone’s MVP 🎖

---

## 🔁 Use All 3 Daily Rentals for Inherited Training

Every day, you can rent another player’s Uma Musume **up to 3 times**.

Always do this. Even if you're low on time. Why?

* Inherited traits = big stat boosts
* You might get a god-tier blue ★3 to pass down
* Top-tier inherited girls (URA9, etc.) can completely change your run

It costs money, yeah, but the payoff is huge.

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

Phew, that was a lot, huh? 😅
Whether you're totally new or already in the grind, if you're skipping any of this — now’s the time to level up.

Stick to this checklist, and you’ll build a roster of top-tier Uma Musume way faster than the average trainer.

Train smart, race hard, and don’t forget to hit the Live Theater after your runs.
We’re all just here to vibe with our horse girls, after all. 💖🐎🎤
